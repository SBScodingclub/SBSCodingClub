A central repository for the SBS coding club at Victoria University, Wellington.

## Overview 

Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/VarunSVenkatesh/SBScodingclub/wiki) to see how to setup your computer for coding in python and R as well as for links to online courses we think are really helpful.
